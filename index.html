            Stress can pile up quickly when having chosen the right programming
            languages. When there are dozens out there, and people telling you
            choose Python, Java, or C++, and you don't understand what they are
            saying.

            I recommend starting with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <h2>HTML, (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
            <p>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building
                block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web
                content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to
                describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or
                functionality/behavior (JavaScript). You could think of HTML as
                the skeleton of your website.

        <div>
            <h2>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. It gives your
                website style and color.

            <p>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
                that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
                high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
                has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                object-orientation, and first-class functions.
